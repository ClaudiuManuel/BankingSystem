# BankingSystem

# I created a basic Banking System to solidify my knowledge regarding DataBases.I learned how to create a connection to a DB using SQLite JDBC driver.  

# How it works?  
# Users pass the database name as a command line argument.After that,the user is only allowed to generate a new credit card number or log into the database with an existing one, at first.All credit card numbers are generated to pass Luhn's algorithm.After the user logs into the DB he is allowed to check his balance,add balance,transfer money to another account from the DB,close the account or simply log out.
